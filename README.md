## TT experiments
The TT experiments are located in the folder tt_experiments.
First run 'main_p.py' to obtain the value function, then run 'main_t.py' to obtain the file 'cost_TT.npy'. This file contains the cost for the different polynomial states and can replace 'cost_TT.npy' in the root folder.
