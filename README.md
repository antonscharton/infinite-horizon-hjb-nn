# Solving HJB Equation using Neural Networks

This repository contains the experimental proof-of-concept developed for my Master's Thesis (2021). It focuses on the numerical implementation of the algorithm described in the thesis, solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation using Neural Netwroks and second order training/optimization methods. Includes comparison to tensor-trains-approximation.
